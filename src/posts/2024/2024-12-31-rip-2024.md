I took a couple of years off doing this, one because life got busy and one because it was an awful, awful year that I'd just as soon forget. [^1]

This year was a bit of a mixed bag but it's ended in a pretty good place - let's do this.

*Previous RIPs: [2018](/blog/2018-12-31-rip-2018), [2019](/blog/2019-12-31-rip-2019), [2020](/blog/2020-12-31-rip-2020), [2021](/blog/2021-12-31-rip-2021).*

## Recap

### January

Started out the year living temporarily in Fitzroy North, thanks to the kind and wonderful [Andrea](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-kirby-talenttable/). Found a new house pretty quickly, living in the eastern suburbs again (the third time in the same square kilometre, even). Got the kids into schools, found a new job (working with Nick and Kaitlin again 🎉), started getting settled back into Australia.

### February

Weird summer - hot periods followed by severe thunderstorms. Went to my first [RORO](https://www.meetup.com/ruby-on-rails-oceania-melbourne/) in years. Found a good trivia night nearby and immediately started our domination 💪

### March

</div>

Wrecked my ankle yet again - I think this time really did the trick, so my running days are over. Bought a Jeep, first time we've driven something other than a Mazda in 21 years.

### April

<div class="max-w-md mx-auto">

![Three humans and a bear](/assets/images/blog/IMG_4733.jpg)
<sup>*It's a long story.*</sup>

</div>

Co-MC'd [RubyConf AU](https://2024.rubyconf.au) with the incomparable [Caitlin Donaldson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/c-donaldson/) - caught up with old friends, met tons of new people, saw some amazing talks. Became a [Melbourne Vixens](https://melbournevixens.com.au/) member and saw a few games with Jo - already renewed for next season.

### May

</div>

The aurora came to visit! It was an incredibly freezing night but worth every second.

### June

Visited St Andrews market, which hasn't changed a bit. Watched [The Bear](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14452776/) season 3. Not much else really.

### July

<div class="max-w-md mx-auto">

![A sign at a train station warning of swooping birds](/assets/images/blog/IMG_5111.jpg)
<sup>*You know you're in Australia when...*</sup>

</div>

Alex's 11th birthday party (a little early but whatevs). Saw Twisters and obsessed over [the soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/album/2Z3lIfc06B7YV1ZN9oZCdS?si=nv24z4I3R1aofUQdtAMKIw) for months afterwards.

### August

</div>

Visited the Sydney office again for our end of financial year party. Enjoyed Olympics memes more than the actual Olympics themselves. Saw Deadpool & Wolverine, which of course was amazing. Celebrated Jo's 13th (!) birthday.

### September

</div>

Eventful month!

* The [ridiculous dominance](https://www.espn.com/college-football/player/stats/_/id/4685415/travis-hunter) of Travis Hunter commenced.

* We welcomed Nyx to our family, she is a very squeaky girl and has *mostly* settled in. (Still won't come near me, but everyone else is OK 😢)

<div class="max-w-md mx-auto">

</div>

* I turned 50 and was spoiled rotten (especially love my Discovery Lego set)...
* ... then was made redundant less than a week later. There was lots of drama around this, it was handled very badly and it was the last thing I needed after the events of last year. So yeah, that sucked.

### October

Spent the month job hunting and marveling at how quickly [one man](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262410/wordpress-fight-trademarks-open-source-mullenweg) can destroy years of goodwill (from those who have not met him personally, at any rate). Thankfully, the job hunting aspect was much less of a train wreck and I started a new role looking after recruiting for [Ferocia](https://ferocia.com.au) ❤️

### November

Cut out all my sources for US political news and I'm much happier for it. The election was like watching a wasted friend who's pissed their pants and is screaming obscenities at anyone who tries to help - I don't need to like your choices, but I don't need to stick around and watch the consequences either.

### December

<div class="max-w-md mx-auto">

![Frank Turner on stage](/assets/images/blog/IMG_0209.jpg)

</div>

Saw [Frank Turner](https://open.spotify.com/artist/27M9shmwhIjRo7WntpT9Rp?si=HQSdYaUdQIqWTff7KsfgTA) at the [Espy](https://hotelesplanade.com.au/gershwin-room/) - brilliant show at an amazing venue. Had our work Xmas party, then took two weeks off work for free! Spent Christmas with family, watched football, got more [Lego](https://www.lego.com/en-au/product/the-milky-way-galaxy-31212), relaxed, and generally decompressed after a year that was slightly less mad than the previous one, but still *a lot*.

*This post was made possible by Google Maps Timeline, Apple Photos, Swarm, and my Instagram/Threads/Bluesky/Mastodon history compensating for my woeful memory.*

[^1]: I actually have forgotten big chunks of the tail end of last year - the last few months are kind of a blur, and there are whole conversations I'm told I had that I have no memory of. No idea if I was just scattered or if I'm actively repressing that time. Either way, mission partially accomplished, I guess?
